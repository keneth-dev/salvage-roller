# Numenera Salvage Roller

Salvaging iotum is a process that has a habit of wasting a lot of time at the table even for experienced Numenera players since it involves a bunch of separate rolls and table lookups. Wrights with Desconstruct and other abilities that impact salvaging will further complicate the whole ordeal and increase the required time investment. This simple tool will roll your iotum salvage for you and output the results in a simple easy-to-read form, freeing your Glaives from perpetual torment of watching the Delve tear apart every numenera piece by piece.

### Usage

1. Input the form data and press submit.
2. Read the results from the *Results* panel below.
3. **Bonus:** Check the roll log in the browser console.
4. *????*
5. **UNLIMITED POWER**

### Notes

* All the salvage sources in a single roll must be of the same level.
* The process will attempt to salvage a single source multiple times until the inevitable failure.
* Natural 20s (major effects) will result in double the amount of iotum.
* Natural 19s (minor effects) will add +1 to the iotum amount roll (or fixed amount).
* Natural 1s (intrusions) will be printed out at the end for the GM to do with as they please.
* If not looking for specific iotum, the first roll is both the discovery and salvage roll.
* Choosing to always use maximum Effort (because you have unlimited time/resources) will simply print out the amount used but will not affect the salvage process.
* Unchecking the Use Effort option will ignore all the other Intellect and Effort options.
* The specific iotum selector will be filtered by the level of the salvage source.
